# GluetunExtendarr

This project aims to provide some additional features to [gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun) by [qdm12](qmc12), which are (by design) not included in the original project.

Currently, the following features are available:

- Automatically resolve the IP address of the VPN server to connect to and update the configuration file accordingly (this will obviously leak the IP address of this container to the DNS server)
- Shuffle 'openvpn' files, so that the VPN server to connect to is chosen randomly on each startup
